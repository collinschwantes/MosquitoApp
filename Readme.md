### Mosquito Control Aid 

This project aims to make a statistical model for mosquito control accessible to individuals interested in mosquito control. The model uses data provided by users in conjunction with temperature, mosquito natural history, and other factors to estimate potential optimal control methods (spraying, fogging, nesting habitat removal, application of larvicide, etc.).
