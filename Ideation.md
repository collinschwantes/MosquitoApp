Historical data vs current data

in a typical year here is the solution

Current estimates to inform the model
- assuming historic patterns hold

How many times do you want to spray 
- 

No "dollar signs" on a mosquito

- Fitting - reasonable fit for birth and death rates over a window
  - assume changing 
  - degree day for growth rates

Model responds to sprays 

Bill
 - Practical mgmt actions
 - any application in forecasting (weather, roads, hurricane models)

How much data will folks have historically
 - either birth and dates or some variation
 - sampled within range of 20 years worth of data 

Modest goal - one model fit to data
  - back to CERTA people, or another 
  - deterministic model would be best 
  - Here are current conditions
Aim simple, POC 
  - data streaming can be integrated with 

Input how ever many years of data - 
  - oviposition and adult data
  - temp is driving changes

Instaar or larva - would imagine that would depend on sampling frequency 

Kevin - ask for example datasets
  ~ grounds you in reality
  ~ Scott - maryland 
  ~ DoD folks?

Fit a simple ARIMA model

if you have 10 years of trap data, 
  - for params in each window
  - tools for undersampling

Scale the tool and flexibility to kinds of data that will be avialable 

larval counts for underlying model

Using aerial adulticide spray - instantaneous (lag depending on instar)

control for lingering effects - 

theoretically appealing or journal contributions

**Most data will not be an uncontrolled system - spray will have been applied**
- may need to find 
- this is the efficacy - on average efficacy based on 

**How much we can fit with temporal variation**
- start with a lot of assumptions 

**Weather events?

- Must done by end of summer
